		<h3 class="text-center">Biryani</h3>
		<p >A world-renowned Indian dish, biryani takes time and practice to make but is worth every bit of the effort. Long-grained rice 
			(like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered with lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables and a thick gravy. The dish is then
			 covered, its lid secured with dough, and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame. This is definitely a special occasion dish.

		<h4>Indian Cusine</h4>
		<p>
			Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given the diversity in soil, climate, 
			culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, 
			and fruits.Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.
			
		</p>	
		<p>
			Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country.
			The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes, 
			tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.Indian cuisine has shaped the history of
			international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.
			Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world,
			especially those from Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America,
			 Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.

		<h4>Indian Food Culture</h4>
		<p>
		Indian food is different from rest of the world not only in taste but also in cooking methods. It reflects a perfect blend of various cultures and ages. Just like Indian culture, food in India has also been influenced by various civilizations, which have contributed their share in its overall development and the present form.Foods of India are better known for its spiciness. Throughout India, be it North India or South India, spices are used generously in food. But one must not forget that every single spice used in Indian dishes carries some or the other nutritional as well as medicinal properties.

		<h3 class="text-center">Paratha</h3>
		<p>Parathas are simple flatbreads that are made with whole wheat (or atta) flour and just a few other simple ingredients. 
			A soft dough is prepared by hand, formed and flattened, and then folded several times to create lots of flaky layers.
			 They are then roasted to perfection and served warm with a variety of Indian dishes.There are also stuffed parathas like Aloo Paratha, Gobi Paratha,
			  Mooli Paratha and Paneer Paratha, which I make often.
